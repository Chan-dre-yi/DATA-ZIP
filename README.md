# DataZip: Encryption-and-decryption-using-Huffman-Coding

In this DSA/DAA project, we are composing a simple algorithm of data compression
to store or transfer text files using less memory space. The algorithm works by first
encrypting the file and then decrypting the file as per need using a greedy
approach. The principle used is on the basis of count/ frequency of the letters/
symbols present in the file, more frequent symbols are allocated more space, and
vice-versa.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ENCRYPTION:
After downloading the code file. 
first create a .txt file in the same folder where you store the code file.
This should be the file you want to encrypt and then later decrypt.
(So store the required text in this .txt file.)
Now when you run the code, put in the filename.txt as input.
And you must then also put another file name you want to store the encrypted text in as input.

After all this you should be good to go :)
(A file storing the encrypted message will be created in the same folder.)

DECRYPTION:
You can then use this encrypted file and run decryption on it to find the original message back.

That's all :)
